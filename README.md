# Rennon

Rennon is a Deep Learning Chatbot "capable" of holding a conversation similar to that of a human. 

At least that was the goal.

## Current Status
#### This project, or the vision, is now living on through [Monday](https://github.com/AfaqAnwar/Monday).

Rennon V 1.0 is trained with a vocabulary size of 100,000. 

V 1.0 was trained on eight months of Reddit comments.

Specifically on  57,182,429 pairs of comments and replies.

The deployable model along with neccesary instructions are obtainable through the [release pages](https://github.com/AfaqAnwar/Rennon/releases) of this repository.

To currently interact with Rennon you can download a model and run the inference.py script locally. This will allow you to see all of the replies with their respective scores.

### Notes

Rennon was developed using a modified version of Google's NMT translation model with an encoder and decoder.

This project was a piece to my [final project](https://github.com/AfaqAnwar/Monday) for the AP Computer Science A class I took during my senior year at Brooklyn Technical High School.
