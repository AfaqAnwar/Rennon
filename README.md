The deployable model along with neccesary instructions are obtainable through the [release pages](https://github.com/AfaqAnwar/Rennon/releases) of this repository.

To interact with Rennon you can download a model and run the inference.py script locally. This will allow you to see all of the replies with their respective scores. Alternatively you can also view the [Monday Repository](https://github.com/AfaqAnwar/Monday) to communicate through a localized wep application.

### Notes

Rennon was developed using a modified version of Google's NMT translation model with an encoder and decoder.

This project was a piece to my [final project](https://github.com/AfaqAnwar/Monday) for the AP Computer Science A class I took during my senior year at Brooklyn Technical High School.
